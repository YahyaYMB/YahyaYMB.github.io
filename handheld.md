## The Idea
The main idea of the electronic project is to create an open sourced hardware using a Raspberry Pi; which is capable of running all sorts of different games. Making it an ideal operating system to implement what I want in a handheld gaming console.

I wanted to make something that used all of the skills that were built in the TEJ3MR course including: soldering, 3D modeling and circuits. Creating a console creates a difficult yet entertaining project that will further strengthen my skills in engineering.

## Materials
- Raspbery Pi 4B w/ SD card & Heatsink
- Arduino Pro Micro
- Screen (DSI compatible)
- Pi-Sugar Battery Module + 40 Pin GPIO header
- Case/Housing
- Push Buttons
- Thumbsticks
- PerfBoards

## Controls
One of the core aspects of gaming is being able to control your movement in an easy way. In my handheld gaming console, I used a microcontroller (Arduino Pro Micro) to control the gamepad.

Esentially, when you click on a button from the gamepad, it sends a signal to the Arduino which then gives information to the Raspberry Pi to inplement whatever is clicked in real life.
