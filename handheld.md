## The Idea
The main idea of the electronic project is to create an open sourced hardware using a Raspberry Pi; which is capable of running all sorts of different games. Making it an ideal operating system to implement what I want in a handheld gaming console.

I wanted to make something that used all of the skills that were built in the TEJ3MR course including: soldering, 3D modeling and circuits. Creating a console creates a difficult yet entertaining project that will further strengthen my skills in engineering.

## Materials
- Raspbery Pi 4B w/ SD card & Heatsink
- Arduino Pro Micro
- Screen (DSI compatible)
- Pi-Sugar Battery Module + 40 Pin GPIO header
- Case/Housing
- Push Buttons
- Thumbsticks
- PerfBoards

## Controls
One of the core aspects of gaming is being able to control your movement in an easy way. In my handheld gaming console, I used a microcontroller (Arduino Pro Micro) to control the gamepad.

Esentially, when you click on a button from the gamepad, it sends a signal to the Arduino which then gives information to the Raspberry Pi to inplement whatever is clicked in real life.

## Screen & Power
Another core aspect of gaming is being able to play your games comfortably. This is why I decided to make two configurations for the handheld; Portable and Non-Portable.

### Portable
In the portable configuration, the console relies on a built-in screen to display the game. To allow for it to be completly portable, the handheld will also have an internal battey which can be charged and allow the user to play anywhere without having to plug the console into an outlet.

### Non-Portable
Unlike the portable configuration, the non-portable setup will not have a built-in display or battery. This is because this configuration is intended to be plugged into a tv or monitor, mostly to play at home. This configuration will require constant power from an outlet. Using the Raspberry Pi's built-in bluetooth, external gamepads can also be used to play games with multiple people, in addition to the built-in controlsof the handheld.
