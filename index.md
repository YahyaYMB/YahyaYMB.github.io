In the TEJ3MR course, I planned out and created a handheld gaming console for my final project in the course. This project demonstrated my ability to design and construct a fully functional electronic device.

### Text Based RPG
As part of the ICS3UR course, I worked towards making a simple text based RPG game based in the Star Wars universe. This project demonstrated my ability to code a basic algorithm responsible for controlling the various enemies the user would enocunter. Furthermore, I also incorporated a basic exploration aspect and a system of scoring which would store past high scores.
