### Text Based RPG
As part of the ICS3UR course, I worked towards making a simple text based RPG game based in the Star Wars universe. This project demonstrated my ability to code a basic algorithm responsible for controlling the various enemies the user would enocunter. Furthermore, I also incorporated a basic exploration aspect and a system of scoring which would store past high scores.
